\section{Introduction}

\section{Infrastructure}
We have written Java classes for interfacing with the MySQL database
back-end and with the Jung graph library

\section{Crawler}

\section{Link-based similarity}
We currently have two algorithms implemented:
\begin{itemize}
\item A friend-of-a-friend (FOAF) algorithm that operates on a
  subgraph consisting of the starting node, nodes connected by its
  outlinks (D=1) and the nodes connected from those nodes (D=2). We
  are considering extending this to also include the parents of the
  D=1 set, or even all the grandparents of D=2, on the intuition that
  nodes with high correferentiality are more likely to be similar

\item the HITS algorithm provided by the Jung framework. This
  currently does not provide very interesting results; most likely
  because of weaknesses in the node selection process for the initial
  subgraph (see above)
\end{itemize}

\section{Content-based similarity}
We are using the Word Vector Tool (WVTool) for doing statistical
analysis of the documents crawled.
